# Getting Started

## The web, Code, and Maps
In this book, we will use [P5.js](http://p5js.org/) as the primary framework for "lego blocking" code to incrementally build visuals, and in our case, maps for the web. P5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of [Processing](https://processing.org/) - to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners - and reinterprets this for today's web. 

By using P5.js, we can take advantage of the extensive documentation, diverse community, and growing code base to develop our understanding of coding web based maps. 

We will also use [Leaflet.js]() to work with interactive web maps and "slippy maps", and [Turf.js]() to do geoprocessing on the web. 

## Setup

Visit [P5js.org](http://p5js.org/) and download the [P5.js Editor](http://p5js.org/download/) for your specific operating system.

The elements of the P5.js Editor:

* Text editor: a nice place to put your code
* Play/Stop Button: Run and Stop your "sketch"
* Console: The console will print out feedback - usually text that you instruct it to print out while you are building your sketch.
* Display Window: "A computer screen is a grid of light elements called pixels. Each pixel has a position within the grid defined by coordinates. " This is where your sketches will be shown.
